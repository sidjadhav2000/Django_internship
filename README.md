# Django_internship
During my Django developer internship, I successfully developed several projects, including a Random Motivational Image Generator that provides users with uplifting images, a Grade Finder App with local authentication for securely accessing student grades, a Bus Route Finder using REST API services to find bus routes efficiently, and a comprehensive Student Management System for managing student information  with CRUD operations.
These projects showcase my skills in Django, REST API integration, front-end development with HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript, as well as implementing features like email authentication and input validations to ensure robust 
functionality and data security.
