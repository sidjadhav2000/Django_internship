# Django_internship
During my Django developer internship, I successfully developed several projects, including a Random Motivational Image Generator that provides users with uplifting images, a Grade Finder App with local authentication for securely accessing student grades, a Bus Route Finder using REST API services to find bus routes efficiently, and a comprehensive Student Management System for managing student information with ease.
